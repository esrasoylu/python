    "Google Cloud's Video Intelligence API is a cloud service that allows various analyses to be performed on videos. The Video Intelligence API automatically processes videos, extracting meaning from the content, providing labeling, recognizing content, conducting sentiment analysis, and transcribing video to text. In this article, we discuss the usage of the Video Intelligence API with Python, demonstrating the transcription of audio from a video and performing sentiment analysis using TextBlob\n",
